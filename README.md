# Weather-Site-Frame
A web site designed to display weather data. This is just the frame. It doesn't actually pull data yet.

You'll notice that these codefiles are only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the data shown in the table on the main webpage is simply hypothetical.
The 'Update' button will only change the date next with the label "Last updated: "
If you click on any of the columns, it will give an alert/pop-up message that simply sasy "Extra weather details for (day)."
